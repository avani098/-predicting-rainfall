# Rainfall Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview

I created this project to predict whether it will rain today based on various atmospheric factors using machine learning. The project involves preprocessing a dataset, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and training multiple machine learning models to achieve accurate predictions.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and statistical summaries are used to explore the data and identify key patterns.
- **Model Training**: The project trains three machine learning models—Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC)—and compares their performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: The models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or any Python IDE

### Python Libraries

Before running the project, install the required libraries using pip:


pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost imbalanced-learn
